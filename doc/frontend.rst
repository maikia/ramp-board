* "dashboard admin": the admin dashboard will give you a big picture regarding
  the submissions done by the participants (new, failed, or scored);
* "private leaderboard": the private leaderboard will contain all information
  about all the submissions of all users. It will display all the different
  scores used for the event, on the public data (via cross-validation) and on
  the private data;
* "private competition leaderboard": the private competition leaderboard is
  similar to the private leaderboard. However, it contains only a single
  submission per user, graded on the official score used for the challenge. The
  score is only computed on the private set and should be used as a final
  challenge classification;
* "update event": you can change some settings linked with an event (e.g. time
  between two submissions, name of events, etc.).

  event. All reported scores are limited to the public dataset only;
* "competition leaderboard": is similar to the leaderboard. However, only

  to either edit and save existing sample code or upload the files in the
  column on the right-hand side;
